# Hospital Emergency Room Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents a Power BI dashboard analyzing 19 months of emergency room (ER) data (April 2023 – October 2024). 
The analysis focuses on operational efficiency, patient demographics, and service utilization to optimize resource allocation and improve patient experience.

## Key Metrics & Insights
The dashboard tracks performance across several critical dimensions:
*   **Operational Efficiency:**
    *   **Average Wait Time:** 35.3 minutes.
    *   **Admission Rate:** ~50% (4,612 admitted vs. 4,604 not admitted).
    *   **SLA Compliance:** 40.68% of patients admitted within the 30-minute target.
*   **Patient Experience:**
    *   **Average Satisfaction Score:** 4.99/10 (indicating a need for service improvement).
*   **Demographics:**
    *   **Age Groups:** Highest volume in the 30–39 and 20–29 age brackets.
    *   **Diversity:** Detailed breakdown by race (White, African American, Multi-racial, Asian).
*   **Departmental Usage:**
    *   Highest referrals to **General Practice** (1,840) and **Orthopedics** (995).

## Data-informed strategic steps
1.  Identify bottlenecks in patient flow (e.g., peak hours at 11 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM).
2.  Adjust staffing for high-volume days (Mondays and Saturdays).
3.  Monitor equity in care delivery across different racial and age demographics.
